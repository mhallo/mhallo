## Hi, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I am a engineer with 7+ years of professional experience, but I've been tinkering with computers longer than that.

I've had the privilege to work and study across the US; I am currently based in San Francisco.

My computing interests lie in high performance distributed systems, vectorization/SIMD, and applied ML.

This account stores my current and previous projects.
