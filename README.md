## Hi, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I am a professional engineer for 7+ years, but I've been tinkering longer than that.

I've had the privilege to work and study across the US; I am currently based in San Francisco.

My interests lie in high performance distributed systems and applied ML.

This account stores my current and previous projects.
